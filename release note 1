USAGE
- take the index.php via the xampp localhost
- see the red dot as the historical point in time
- press f5 for the action to begin
- the green dot represents the direction of the line
- the ellipse (later a square perhaps) for now jumps random through the area (will catch and follow the line end later)
- (could be a tracking of a rope through a lake for a robot which uses a rgb camera to have a automatic direction target)

Based on a research project of SELU, Hammond, United States of America regarding underwater data collection:
